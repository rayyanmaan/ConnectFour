        "\n",
        "### Position Evaluation Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation approach divides the board into \"windows\" of 4 adjacent positions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). Each window is scored based on its potential to contribute to a win, with higher scores assigned to more favorable configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`evaluate_window()`**:\n",
        "   - This function assigns scores to each window of 4 positions based on piece configurations\n",
        "   - The scoring system prioritizes:\n",
        "     - Complete wins (4 pieces): 100,000 points - extremely high value ensures the AI will always choose a winning move\n",
        "     - 3 pieces with an empty space: 10 points - significant value as these are one move away from winning\n",
        "     - 2 pieces with two empty spaces: 3 points - moderate value for developing threats\n",
        "   - Defensive scoring (negative values) penalizes opponent's threats:\n",
        "     - 3 opponent pieces with an empty space: -80 points - high penalty encourages blocking imminent threats\n",
        "     - 2 opponent pieces with two empty spaces: -5 points - moderate penalty for potential threats\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`score_position()`**:\n",
        "   - Evaluates the entire board by applying `evaluate_window()` to every possible 4-position window\n",
        "   - Includes a center column preference (6 points per piece) - this is strategically important because:\n",
        "     - Center placement provides access to more winning paths\n",
        "     - Control of the center offers more flexibility for future moves\n",
        "\n",
        "### Heuristic Design Rationale:\n",
        "The carefully calibrated scoring values reflect the strategic priorities in Connect Four:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Winning immediately takes absolute priority (100,000 points)\n",
        "2. Blocking opponent wins is nearly as important (-80 point penalty for opponent threats)\n",
        "3. Building toward wins (3-in-a-row) is the next priority (10 points)\n",
        "4. Controlling the center column provides positional advantage (6 points per piece)\n",
        "5. Early development (2-in-a-row) receives modest encouragement (3 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "This multi-tiered approach allows the AI to balance immediate threats, future opportunities, and positional advantages. The specific values were fine-tuned through testing to create an AI that plays both defensively and offensively depending on the board state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation function is a key component that directly applies the concept of heuristic evaluation from AI search algorithms (#search learning objective), translating abstract board positions into concrete numerical values that guide decision-making."

        "This section implements the visual representation of the game state using Pygame. These functions translate the abstract board representation into an interactive, visually appealing game interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Visualization Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "The visualization implements:\n",
        "1. A classic Connect Four board appearance with a blue grid and circular slots\n",
        "2. Flat, disk-like pieces instead of spherical ones for a modern look\n",
        "3. Visual feedback through animations and hovering pieces\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Functions Explained:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`draw_board()`**:\n",
        "   - Renders the complete game board with all pieces\n",
        "   - Creates the blue grid with black circular openings\n",
        "   - Places red (player) and yellow (AI) pieces based on the current board state\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`draw_disk()`**:\n",
        "   - Renders individual game pieces with a flat disk design\n",
        "   - Includes visual enhancements:\n",
        "     - Dark edges to create depth perception\n",
        "     - Small highlight reflection for a subtle 3D effect\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`get_column_for_x()`**:\n",
        "   - Converts mouse x-coordinate to a board column\n",
        "   - Includes boundary checking to prevent out-of-range errors\n",
        "   - Ensures user clicks are interpreted correctly\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`animate_drop()`**:\n",
        "   - Creates the signature \"falling\" animation when pieces are played\n",
        "   - Uses acceleration to simulate gravity for natural movement\n",
        "   - Carefully handles piece rendering to prevent visual glitches\n",
        "   - Includes collision detection with existing pieces\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`draw_hovering_piece()`**:\n",
        "   - Shows a preview of where the current piece will be dropped\n",
        "   - Aligns to the column grid for visual clarity\n",
        "   - Changes color based on whose turn it is\n",
        "\n",
        "### Design Rationale:\n",
        "\n",
        "The visual design focuses on:\n",
        "- **Clarity**: Clear distinction between player and AI pieces\n",
        "- **Feedback**: Immediate visual response to player actions\n",
        "- **Polish**: Animations and subtle details for a professional feel\n",
        "- **Familiarity**: Maintaining the recognizable Connect Four aesthetic\n",
        "\n",
        "The animation system adds significant value to the player experience by:\n",
        "- Making piece placement more satisfying\n",
        "- Creating natural pacing for the game\n",
        "- Providing time for players to process each move\n",
        "\n",
        "These visualization functions bridge the gap between the abstract board representation and a concrete, engaging game experience. While not directly related to AI concepts, creating an intuitive interface allows players to focus on strategy rather than struggling with the interface."

        "This section implements the UI elements that facilitate player interaction beyond the core gameplay. These components handle game state communication, player decisions, and overall flow management.\n",
        "\n",
        "### UI Design Philosophy\n",
        "\n",
        "The UI follows minimalist design principles with:\n",
        "1. Clean, uncluttered layouts\n",
        "2. Clear visual hierarchy\n",
        "3. Consistent styling across all elements\n",
        "4. Intuitive interaction patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components Explained:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`draw_button()`**:\n",
        "   - Creates interactive buttons with consistent styling\n",
        "   - Features:\n",
        "     - Rounded corners for modern appearance\n",
        "     - Clear borders for distinct boundaries\n",
        "     - Automatic text scaling to fit available space\n",
        "     - Visual feedback through color\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`create_win_message()`**:\n",
        "   - Displays game outcome when a player wins\n",
        "   - Customizes message based on winner (player vs AI)\n",
        "   - Includes a \"PLAY AGAIN\" button to restart the game\n",
        "   - Uses color coding to reinforce the winner (red for player, yellow for AI)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`create_tie_message()`**:\n",
        "   - Shows neutral \"DRAW\" message when the game ends in a tie\n",
        "   - Maintains consistent styling with win messages\n",
        "   - Offers the same restart functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`draw_start_screen()`**:\n",
        "   - Creates the initial game configuration screen\n",
        "   - Features:\n",
        "     - Visually appealing title presentation\n",
        "     - Subtle background pattern for visual interest\n",
        "     - Clear difficulty selection options (Easy, Normal, Hard)\n",
        "     - Decorative game pieces for thematic consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Button System**:\n",
        "   - Returns the button's rectangle for click detection\n",
        "   - Handles various text lengths through dynamic font sizing\n",
        "   - Maintains consistent appearance across the interface\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Difficulty Selection**:\n",
        "   - Directly maps user choice to AI search depth:\n",
        "     - Easy: 2 levels deep (more accessible)\n",
        "     - Normal: 4 levels deep (balanced challenge)\n",
        "     - Hard: 5 levels deep (significant challenge)\n",
        "   - Visual arrangement suggests increasing difficulty\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Game Flow Control**:\n",
        "   - Implements modal interfaces (screens that require interaction before proceeding)\n",
        "   - Handles event loops to wait for player decisions\n",
        "   - Manages game restarts without requiring application restart\n",
        "\n",
        "### Design Rationale:\n",
        "\n",
        "The UI design emphasizes:\n",
        "- **Accessibility**: Clear options with obvious functions\n",
        "- **Visual Consistency**: Unified styling throughout the experience\n",
        "- **User Control**: Clear indication of game state and available actions\n",
        "- **Engagement**: Visually pleasing elements that enhance the experience\n",
        "\n",
        "This UI layer transforms what could be a purely functional game into a complete, polished experience that guides players through the entire gameplay loop from start to completion."

        "\n",
        "This section implements the central control flow that orchestrates all game components. The main game loop manages the turn-based gameplay, user input, AI decision-making, and win condition checking.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Game Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The main game follows an event-driven architecture typical of interactive applications:\n",
        "1. Initialize the game state and display\n",
        "2. Enter a continuous loop that processes events and updates the display\n",
        "3. Handle game termination and potential restarts\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Game Initialization**:\n",
        "   - Sets up the Pygame environment and display window\n",
        "   - Shows the start screen to gather player preferences\n",
        "   - Creates a fresh game board\n",
        "   - Randomly determines the first player for fairness\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Event Handling**:\n",
        "   - Processes mouse movement for piece hovering feedback\n",
        "   - Detects mouse clicks for piece placement\n",
        "   - Handles window closing events\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Turn Management**:\n",
        "   - Alternates between player and AI turns\n",
        "   - Ensures all game rules are properly enforced\n",
        "   - Provides appropriate visual feedback for current turn\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **AI Move Processing**:\n",
        "   - Shows \"thinking\" indication during AI's turn\n",
        "   - Adds a strategic delay to make AI moves feel natural\n",
        "   - Uses the minimax algorithm to determine optimal move\n",
        "   - Includes special case for immediate wins/blocks for better performance\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Game State Monitoring**:\n",
        "   - Constantly checks for win conditions after each move\n",
        "   - Detects tie games when the board fills without a winner\n",
        "   - Triggers appropriate end-game screens based on outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Frame Rate Control**:\n",
        "   - Uses Pygame's clock functionality to maintain consistent performance\n",
        "   - Balances smoothness with processing requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "### Design Rationale:\n",
        "\n",
        "The game loop design prioritizes:\n",
        "- **Responsiveness**: Immediate feedback to player actions\n",
        "- **Fairness**: Equal turn opportunities with random first player\n",
        "- **Clarity**: Clear indication of game state and current turn\n",
        "- **Performance**: Efficient processing that maintains smooth gameplay\n",
        "\n",
        "### AI Integration:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main loop seamlessly integrates the AI opponent by:\n",
        "1. Calling the minimax algorithm during the AI's turn\n",
        "2. Applying the chosen move to the game state\n",
        "3. Providing visual feedback during AI \"thinking\" time\n",
        "4. Creating natural pacing through strategic delays\n",
        "\n",
        "This main control system demonstrates important software engineering principles (#aicoding learning objective) by organizing complex, interactive behavior into manageable components with clear responsibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program entry point (`if __name__ == \"__main__\"`) follows Python best practices, allowing the game to be imported as a module or run directly as a script."

        "The analysis evaluated the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning across search depths 1-6, testing on both random board configurations (20 games per depth) and specific test scenarios. Key findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time complexity** grows exponentially with depth (r=0.81, p=0.051), from 2ms at depth 1 to 2.07s at depth 6\n",
        "- **Win rates** showed variability (15-40%) but no clear depth-dependent pattern (r=-0.47, p=0.35)\n",
        "- **Evaluation scores** had extremely high variance (±400,000-600,000) due to the 1,000,000/-1,000,000 win/loss scores dominating averages\n",

        "Key observations:\n",
        "- Depth 1 surprisingly achieved the highest win rate (40%)\n",
        "- Score variance was extremely high at all depths\n",
        "- Time increased ~1000x from depth 1 to 6\n",
        "\n",
        "## Test Scenario Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "### One-Move Win Scenario\n",
        "The AI perfectly identified the winning move (column 3) at all depths, achieving:\n",
        "- Consistent 1,000,000 evaluation scores\n",
        "- Execution times from 2ms (depth 1) to 1.1s (depth 6)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Block Needed Scenario\n",
        "The AI consistently chose column 0 (correct blocking move) but:\n",
        "- Scores oscillated between positive and negative values\n",
        "- Never registered as a \"win\" since blocking doesn't immediately win\n",
        "- Demonstrated the algorithm's defensive capability\n",
        "\n",
        "### Early Game Scenario\n",
        "Showed more variability in decisions (columns 1,3,4):\n",
        "- Scores remained modest (13-63)\n",
        "- No winning moves found at any depth\n",
        "- Depth 3 made the most aggressive move (column 4)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mid Game Scenario\n",
        "Similar to early game but with:\n",
        "- Higher baseline scores (most >0 except depth 6)\n",
        "- Preference for columns 2 and 4\n",
        "- No winning conditions found\n",
        "\n",
        "### Endgame Scenario\n",
        "Forced move in column 3 was correctly identified:\n",
        "- Instant decision times (0ms)\n",
        "- Perfect 1,000,000 scores at all depths\n",
        "- Highlighted terminal node handling\n",
        "\n",
        "## Statistical Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Depth vs Time**: Strong positive correlation (r=0.81, p=0.051) confirms exponential time growth\n",
        "- **Depth vs Win Rate**: Moderate negative correlation (r=-0.47, p=0.35) suggests no significant relationship\n",
        "- **Confidence Intervals**: Wide win rate CIs indicate need for more trials (especially for depths 2-4)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The AI performs exceptionally well in clear scenarios (one-move wins, forced moves)\n",
        "2. Win rate doesn't consistently improve with deeper search, suggesting:\n",
        "   - Evaluation function may need refinement\n",
        "   - 20 trials per depth may be insufficient\n",
        "3. Time complexity becomes prohibitive beyond depth 4-5 for practical use\n",
        "4. The 1,000,000/-1,000,000 scoring for wins/losses dominates evaluation, potentially masking positional advantages"

        "- **Exponential growth**: Computation time follows the fitted curve `0.001*e^(1.221*depth)`, showing:\n",
        "  - Practical feasibility (<100ms) up to depth 4\n",
        "  - Prohibitive 1-10s range at depths 5-6\n",
        "- **Key divergence**:\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. Win Rate vs Search Depth\n",
        "Critical findings:\n",
        "- **Inverse relationship**: Highest win rate (40%) at depth 1 decreases to 15-20% at higher depths\n",
        "- **Statistical uncertainty**: Overlapping CIs suggest no significant difference between depths 2-6\n",
        "- **Threshold breach**: Only depth 1 exceeds the 20% benchmark\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core implication**: The evaluation function's win/loss detection (depth 1 strength) may be overshadowing positional evaluation at higher depths.\n",
        "\n",

        "Pattern analysis:\n",
        "- **Depth parity effect**:\n",
        "  - Odd depths: Positive scores (10 to 23)\n",
        "  - Even depths: Negative scores (-50 to -60)\n",
        "- **Behavioral consistency**: Always selects column 0 despite score fluctuations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategic paradox**: Correct blocking moves occur regardless of whether the evaluation function considers the position favorable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Decision Consistency Across Configurations\n",
        "Comparative observations:\n",
        "- **Early Game**:\n",
        "  - Strong center bias (columns 3-4) at 5/6 depths\n",
        "  - Depth 4 anomaly (column 1) aligns with score oscillation patterns\n",
        "- **Mid Game**:\n",
        "  - Clear column preferences (2 and 4)\n",
        "  - More depth-stable than early game\n",
        "\n",
        "**Developmental insight**: The AI shows:\n",
        "- Robust opening principles (center control)\n",
        "- Emerging adaptability in mid-game\n",
        "- Potential evaluation instability at specific depths (notably depth 4)"
